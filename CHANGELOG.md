- Relax Python requirement to >=3.10

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-06

### Changed

- Fixed a spelling error in the class name `MindatApiKeyManeger` -> `MindatApiKeyManager`.
- `MindatApi` and `MindatApiKeyManager` now support an optional `ENDPOINT` parameter to customize the API endpoint.

### Fixed

- Updated several endpoints to include the `v1/` prefix to align with recent changes on the Mindat server.
- Corrected parameter names to match the official Mindat API documentation (e.g., changed `id__in` to `id_in`).

### Removed

- Removed outdated endpoint support for:
  - `countries`
  - `locgeoregion2`
  - `locobject`
  - `photocount`

  These will be reintroduced in future versions based on the new Mindat API structure.

### Known Issues

- Many existing functions and endpoints are deprecated due to recent updates on the Mindat API server.
- For the latest available endpoints and parameters, refer to the [official Mindat API documentation](https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/).
- The OpenMindat package is undergoing migration to support the updated API schema. This process is ongoing and may temporarily affect feature availability.
